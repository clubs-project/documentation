We introduce a novel evaluation scheme for the human evaluation of different machine translation systems. Our method is based on direct comparison of two sentences at a time by human judges. These binary judgments are then used to decide between all possible rankings of the systems. The advantages of this new method are the lower dependency on extensive evaluation guidelines, and a tighter focus on a typical evaluation task, namely the ranking of systems. Furthermore we argue that machine translation evaluations should be regarded as statistical processes, both for human and automatic evaluation. We show how confidence ranges for state-of-the-art evaluation measures such as WER and TER can be computed accurately and efficiently without having to resort to Monte Carlo estimates. We give an example of our new evaluation scheme, as well as a comparison with classical automatic and human evaluation on data from a recent international evaluation campaign.

 abstract = {This paper presents a general statistical methodology for the analysis of multivariate categorical data arising from observer reliability studies. The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},
