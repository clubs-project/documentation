The file __Queries_and_Topic_Descriptions_eng_ger_esp_fre.csv__ contains a set of 50 English queries that were sent to the PubPsych search engine by real users. These queries were used for evaluation of the different systems in the CLUBS project. They were also manually translated into German, Spanish and French. Additionally, all queries have a query description that describes the information need behind each of them. This description was later used by human assessors to rate the relevance of retrieved documents for a given query.
